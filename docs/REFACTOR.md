# Planned refactor for Particle Dev

* [ ] Change Atom commands used only for internal notifications to use the event emitter
* [ ] Remove package name from event emitter event names
* [ ] Switch to `Particle.js` from `spark`
* [ ] Break out code from `main.coffee` into separate files
* [X] Convert to ES6 from CoffeeScript
* [ ] Remove atom-space-pen-views same way [Atom has done it](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13254)
